# XROS-portfolio
<h2>Some projects of my own to demonstrate some rough idea for the proposal.</h2>
<ul>
  <li><h1>Fanisko</h1>

</h2>
<ul>
 <li> 
<p>This is a sample gif for the project of NFT made with PlayCanvas as github doesn't allow playcanvas to be embedded in it directly, it can be seen here:
  <a href="https://playcanv.as/p/11e13c15/">here</a></p></li>
  <li>
    <p>The speed being displayed above is not same as in the model created in the Playcanvas, it is better to click <a href="https://playcanv.as/p/11e13c15/">here</a> as it can be seen better there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this example, the alien in the example above is rotating automatically horizontally which can be changed to user interactive by keyboard using left and right arrow keys or touch in smartphones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While in this example, button for upgrading is not used but it can be done and changing some parts or adding some parts to the NFTs as an animation can attract audience better as specified in the project description.</p>  
  </li>
  <li>The above gif shows a 3D alien whereas in <a href="https://playcanv.as/p/uEdFsL9r/">this</a>( opens a QR code for users to view on the web). The alien can be seen rotating using AR technology, it responds to hand gestures to after it is placed.</p> </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alien moves with the camera unitl you click on "Tap to Place" button. After that you can shrink it's size using hand and you can flick the alien too.</p>
  </li>
